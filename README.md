rsa-cypher
==========

2nd assignment of the subject, security and vulnerability in networks of the University of Stavanger:

In this assignment you will implement a rudimentary RSA cipher.
 
Your cipher should use the principles of RSA. It is not required to be implemnted with full size RSA parameters. You shoud, however,  describe in your documentation how the parameters are chosen and eventual limitations on them. 
The program should take input from the user for both encryption and decryption. The format of the input can be either binary or character data for encryption, and binary for decryption.
The program should have some kind of user interface, but not necessarily a GUI.
Programming language should be Java, C#, C++ or similar. If you want to use some other language, please contact the lecturer or the T.A. first.
 
Contents of final delivery:
* Source code
* Runnable program
* Documentation including description of chosen components and algorithms
